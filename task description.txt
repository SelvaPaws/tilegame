array of coloured tiles
2 teams, each own a couple colours
take by stacking your tile on any adjacent tile
  (effect: tile colour becomes deeper)
objective: ?
  1. remove tiles of your colour
  2. fake tiles of the opposition or something
extra ability: "moving" an isolated tile (no adjacent) clears all tiles of that colour
  maybe only if no other tiles are touching something

 strategy-introducting idea:
one can stack up as many tiles in an adjacent manner as they like as long as all but the last one is the same colour as you
that way players can work towards making chainssss
and breaking other players' chains
and possibly isolating entire groups so that those players can't reduce the amount of tiles they have left beyond those in the island
and they can stop prematurely so it's like that game where you have a pile of little coins and you can take 1 or 2 per turn and the one who takes the last coin loses

and since each player would get 1 to 3 colours depending on the number of players, there would be a minimum of 4 colours with 4 players
2 players = 3 each (total of 6)

Seems like it adds a bit of strategy, have you been testing the rules for balance?
I see, and what about implementing an ai?
