array of coloured tiles
2 teams, each own a couple colours
take by stacking your tile on any adjacent tile
  (effect: tile colour becomes deeper)
objective: ?
  1. remove tiles of your colour
  2. fake tiles of the opposition or something
extra ability: "moving" an isolated tile (no adjacent) clears all tiles of that colour
  maybe only if no other tiles are touching something
